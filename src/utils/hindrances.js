			"Whether or not your cowpoke did something wrong, the law thinks he did! His face is on posters all over the territory, and maybe farhter afield too. The nature of the crime and the Marshal's sense of 'sport' determines how far and wide the charges may have circulated, but someone somewhere is looking for you.\n\nAs well as having someone after his hide, your hombre also has a price on his head. For the Minor version, there's a reward of 1d6 x $100. A Major Hindrance ups the bounty to a tempting 1d6 x $1000. The player and the Marshal should agree where the bounty can be collected.",
