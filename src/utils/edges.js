Its Agents are a secretive lot, and do not share information outside their ranks if they can avoid it, not even with the local law. This Edge is for full-time Agents beholden to the Agency. Other characters may work for the Agency on a parttime “troubleshooter” basis, but only those who work for the Agency every minute of every day of their lives until they retire (rarely) or die (much more common) should take this Edge. Agents are expected to spy on the enemies of the Union, seek out and contain, destroy, or capture weird creatures, and generally follow the orders handed down to them by the Agency itself. These secretive servants of the Union have jurisdiction anywhere within its borders, but are expected not to reveal their credentials except under extreme and desperate circumstances. Agents receive a free Gatling pistol upon completion of their training course and always add +1 to their Guts checks. Agents are simply ranked as Grade 0 through 5. Grade 6 is reserved for the legendary leader of the Agency, the “Ghost,” though rumors of his recent demise are widely circulated. Makin' Heroes 41 Agent characters begin at Grade 0, and test for promotion upon the completion of each assignment or the destruction of some great evil (Marshal’s call). See the Promotion Table on the left for the procedure. Pay is $40 per month at Grade 0, though Agents have access to more funds on a temporary and returnable basis, as shown on the table below. These allotments are rough guidelines per month—not absolutes. If an Agent absolutely needs people, equipment, or other resources beyond his rank to stop some unholy threat, he’ll either get it or a more senior Agent will be sent out to take over. If a more senior Agent is needed, however, that Agent will most likely get the promotion and accolades instead."

			'The South uses the Texas Rangers to police its interior. These hardened men hunt the High Plains and other regions for outlaws, bandits, deserters, and Union spies. The Tombstone Epitaph claims that, like the Agency, they are tasked with seeking out stranger prey as well, but only crackpots believe those bedtime stories, right? Rangers advance along military ranks, but always start as privates. Ranger privates are given a badge (giving them +2 Charisma to those who respect its authority, and jurisdiction over all civilians of the Confederacy), a copy of Fugitives from Justice (giving them +2 to Law-based Common Knowledge rolls), and a general direction to mosey toward. Pay is slightly higher for the Rangers than for their Union counterparts, but Rangers of all ranks are expected to handle things themselves according to the old creed, “One riot, one Ranger.” On the completion of every encounter with outlaws or other weirdness, the Ranger must report in and the Marshal can check for promotion on the promotion table.'

Once per session, he may spend a Fate Chip of any color and treat it as if it were a blue chip. Fate’s Favored may be selected more than once, but only one time per Rank. Each time you choose it, your hero gains another use of the ability in each session.'

The Weird West is a superstitious place, where rumors and old wives’ tales abound. Just occasionally, though, these folktales contain a germ of truth. A knack is just that—folklore come true. Well, now you get to choose one of the special events that coincided with the time of your birth. Each one gives you access to a special ability, which you can activate by using a Fate Chip (of any color). If you don’t have a Fate Chip to spare, you can’t use your knack.'
